# is mi

long long ago, in i'm a child.

At that time, I was still in school and my English class was terrible.

In class, the foreign language teacher asked me to go to the podium to write English words.

and I wrote "This is mi" .

My classmates laughed uncontrollably when they saw it,

and then they called me 'is mi'
